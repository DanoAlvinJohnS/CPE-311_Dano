Instead of selecting the values we want to keep, we remove the values we don’t want... like a reverse abstraction of filtering. I use a as the source array and b as a blacklist. I then iterate through a, using x to represent each value so the original array remains unchanged. For each value, I check whether x is not in the blacklist. If it isn’t, I add it to the result array. If the value exists in the blacklist, it is skipped.
